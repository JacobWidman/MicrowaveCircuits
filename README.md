# MicrowaveCircuits
This was from my class in Microwave Circuits Design (undergraduate)

These are templates for creating low-pass filters and Low Noise Amplifiers
WARNING: This is suboptimal code that was created to fufill a specific task: 
  The filter code requires the possession of charts on filters 
  The LNA code is functional for calculating all but the final Gamma_S for designing matching networks on perfect transmission lines
